        Hi, my name is Brandon Otero and I live in East Oak Lane, Philadelphia, PA. I'm 22 yrs old turning 23 later this year. I was born here in Philly, but my ethnic background is Colombian & Puerto Rican. I'm actually waiting for my 23andMe results to come in from the lab to uncover my family tree and ethnic background.
    </p>

        My favorite things to do: to drive around in my Honda S2K, play videos games (COD, Halo, Fortnite, etc.), and learn new things. My goals for this year is to graduate from CodingBootcamp; find a job in full stack development, and go on a getaway vacation to a tropical region.
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy playing soccer & baseball. I currently attend Penn State Abington, going for a BS in Information, Science & Technology.
